## 1. Introduction

This Project Plan outlines the tasks, milestones, timelines, and resources required for the development of TaskMaster AI. It considers the project's scope, functional and non-functional requirements, design specifications, and the development constraints of a solo developer with limited time and resources. The developer has 10 hours per week to dedicate to this project. The plan prioritizes delivering a functional core system (MVP) initially, with a roadmap for future expansion and enhancements. The project will follow an iterative development process, allowing for flexibility and adaptation as progress unfolds.

## 8. Risk Management

| **Risk**                                                | **Likelihood** | **Impact** | **Mitigation Strategy**                                                                                                                                                  |
|------------------------------------------------------|----------------|------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Limited Development Time and Resources**            |  Medium        | High      | Prioritize essential features, leverage open-source tools, and adopt a flexible and iterative development approach. Regularly reassess priorities based on available time and energy. |
| **Lack of Coding Experience**                           |  High          | Medium     |  Focus on continuous learning, break down complex tasks, leverage available resources (documentation, tutorials, community support), and seek assistance when needed.                  |
| **Mental Health Challenges**                           |  High          | High      |  Prioritize well-being, set realistic goals, take breaks, practice self-care, and seek support from mental health professionals when necessary. Adjust project timelines and workload as needed to prevent burnout. |
| **Reliance on Free AI Models and APIs**               |  Medium        | Medium     |  Carefully evaluate the capabilities and limitations of free AI models. Develop fallback strategies or consider using more robust paid services if free models prove insufficient for certain tasks. |
| **Potential Legal and Ethical Issues (Web Scraping, Licensing)** |  Medium        | High      |  Thoroughly research and comply with all relevant licensing agreements for open-source AI models. Ensure compliance with data privacy regulations when web scraping. Prioritize ethical data usage and model selection. |
| **Complexity of Multi-Agent Framework and Workflow Management**  |  High          | High      | Break down complex tasks into smaller, manageable units.  Use a modular design, clear documentation, and iterative development to handle the complexity. |
| **Unexpected Technical Challenges:**                    |  Medium        | High      |  Allocate a buffer in the timeline, research potential solutions, and involve the community or seek help from experienced developers if needed. |

**Regular Reviews:** Review and update the risk management plan monthly.
