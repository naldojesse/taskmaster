* **External AI APIs:** TaskMaster AI integrates with external AI APIs, including:
    - **Groq API:**  Provides access to models like LLama 3 and Mixtral.
    - **OpenRouter AI API:**  Offers models like Toppy.

### 3.3 Data Flow

**Diagram:** (Refer to Figure 2: Data Flow Diagram)

**Narrative Description:**

1.  **User Interaction:** The user interacts with the system via the command-line interface (CLI). 
2. **Request to API Gateway:** The CLI sends a request to the API Gateway.
3.  **Routing:**  The API Gateway determines the appropriate component to handle the request and routes it accordingly. 
4. **Task Assignment (Core Engine):**  For task-related requests, the Core Engine receives the request, parses it, and determines the appropriate agent for the task based on the agent's capabilities.
5. **Agent Execution:** The Core Engine delegates the task to the selected agent module.
6. **Agent-Memory Interaction:**  The agent may interact with short-term memory to store and retrieve temporary data during task execution. 
7. **External AI API Calls:**  If necessary, the agent makes API calls to external services like Groq or OpenRouter AI to leverage their AI models.
8. **Orchestrator Coordination:** The Orchestrator manages dependencies between tasks, ensuring tasks are executed in the correct order.  It also handles concurrency control to prevent conflicts.
9. **Long-Term Memory Storage:** Upon task completion, relevant data, knowledge, or results may be stored in long-term memory.
10. **Asynchronous Communication (Optional):** If a task requires significant processing time, the agent can use a message queue to notify the Core Engine of completion, enabling the system to handle other tasks concurrently. 
11. **Response to User:**  The result of the agent's work is sent back through the Core Engine and API Gateway to the CLI, providing feedback to the user. 

## 4. Module Design

### 4.1 Core Engine

**Description:**  The Core Engine is the central control unit of TaskMaster AI, responsible for managing task execution, coordinating agents, and interacting with other modules.

**Class Diagram:** (Refer to Figure 3: Core Engine Class Diagram)

**Data Structures:**

*   **`Task`:** 
    *   `task_id`: INTEGER (Primary Key)
    *   `description`: TEXT 
    *   `status`: TEXT (e.g., 'created', 'in_progress', 'completed', 'failed')
    *   `agent_assigned`: TEXT 
    *   `input_data`: TEXT (Can store JSON data)
    *   `output_data`: TEXT (Can store JSON data)
*   **`Agent`:**  
    *   `agent_id`: TEXT (Primary Key)
    *   `type`: TEXT (e.g., 'nlp', 'technical')
    *   `capabilities`: DICTIONARY (e.g.,  `{'summarization': 0.8, 'information_extraction': 0.9}`)
    *   `status`: TEXT (e.g., 'available', 'busy', 'offline')

**Algorithms & Logic:**

*   **Task Queue:** The Core Engine uses a task queue to manage incoming tasks, ensuring they are processed in the order received.
*   **Agent Factory Pattern:** The Core Engine utilizes the *Agent Factory* pattern to create and initialize different agent types. This pattern provides a centralized and standardized way to create agent instances, promoting code reusability and maintainability. 
*   **Agent Selection (Task Matching):**  The Core Engine employs a rule-based or scoring system to match tasks to the most suitable agent based on the agent's capabilities. The `capabilities` dictionary in the `Agent` object will be used to determine the agent's proficiency in specific skills. 

### 4.2  NLP Agent 

**Description:** The NLP Agent specializes in Natural Language Processing tasks, leveraging open-source or free AI models. It provides the following capabilities:

* **Core NLP Functionalities:**
    - Text Summarization: Summarizes text, extracting key information, using models like LLama 3, Mixtral, or Toppy.
    - Information Extraction: Extracts entities, relationships, and facts from unstructured text using techniques like Named Entity Recognition (NER).
    - Response Generation: Generates text responses based on input and context using available models.
* **Additional Capabilities:**
    - **Sentiment Analysis:** Determines the emotional tone or sentiment expressed in text, which can be valuable for analyzing user feedback or social media posts.
    - **Intent Classification:**  Identifies the purpose or intent behind user queries, essential for building conversational agents or chatbots. 
    - **Question Answering:**  Provides direct answers to user questions based on given text or a knowledge base.
    - **Language Translation (Potential):**  May include language translation capabilities if suitable open-source models or APIs are available. 

**Tools and Libraries:**

- **OpenRouter AI API:**  For accessing models like Toppy. 
- **Hugging Face Transformers:** A versatile library providing access to various pre-trained NLP models. 
- **spaCy:**  An efficient library for NLP tasks, including NER and text processing.

### 4.3 Technical Agent

**Description:**  The Technical Agent assists users with coding and software development tasks. It provides the following capabilities:

* **Core Functionalities:**
    - Code Generation: Generates code snippets in Python based on user requirements, using open-source models and APIs.
    - Debugging: Assists with debugging by identifying potential errors, leveraging static code analysis and available debugging tools.
    - Documentation Creation: Generates basic code documentation using open-source documentation generation tools.
* **Additional Capabilities:**
    - **Code Style Analysis:** Analyzes code for style and formatting compliance, using open-source linters like `pylint` or `flake8`.
    - **Test Case Generation (Potential):**  May explore generating basic unit tests based on code, if suitable open-source tools are found. 
    - **Code Completion (Potential):**  May consider integrating with open-source IDE extensions or tools that offer code completion suggestions.

**Tools and Libraries:**

- **CodeT5:** An open-source AI code generator.
- **Polycoder:** An open-source model for code generation, trained on a multi-language codebase.
- **DeepCode (if free tier available):**  An AI code analysis tool for bug detection.
- **pylint and flake8:** Python linters for code style and quality analysis. 

### 4.4 Memory Management

**Description:** The Memory Management module handles the storage and retrieval of information for agents, using both short-term and long-term memory approaches. It plays a crucial role in maintaining conversational context, storing task results, and potentially managing agent knowledge.

**Class Diagram:** (Refer to Figure 4: Memory Management Class Diagram)

**Data Structures:**
* `MemoryRecord`:  Represents a record in memory, containing data, timestamps, and associated agent/task information.

**Algorithms & Logic:**

* **Short-Term Memory:**
    * **Implementation:**  For initial development, short-term memory will be implemented using Python's built-in `functools.lru_cache` decorator for simple caching. This approach minimizes resource consumption and is suitable for managing small amounts of frequently accessed data.
    * **Alternative (Redis):**  If performance issues arise or more advanced caching features are needed, Redis will be considered as an alternative. Redis is an in-memory data structure store that offers high performance, persistence options, and scalability.
* **Long-Term Memory:**
    * **Implementation:**  Long-term memory will utilize a lightweight database (SQLite) for initial development.  Data will be stored in tables with appropriate indexing to facilitate efficient retrieval. 
    * **Alternative (Vector Databases):**  For tasks that involve similarity-based search, such as retrieving relevant conversational history or managing knowledge embeddings, vector databases like FAISS or Milvus will be considered. 
    * **Alternative (Knowledge Graphs):** If TaskMaster AI's functionality expands to require more complex knowledge representation and reasoning, a graph database like Neo4j will be evaluated. 
* **Memory Purging:**  A time-based purging mechanism will be implemented to remove memory records older than a configurable threshold (e.g., 30 days) to prevent long-term storage from growing unmanageably large.  

**Specific Considerations:**

* **Conversational History:** Short-term conversational history can be managed using the caching mechanism. Long-term history might be stored as embeddings in a vector database like FAISS or Milvus.
* **Task Results:**  Recent task results can be cached, while a persistent database like SQLite or a knowledge graph like Neo4j can be used for storing and querying historical task data.
* **Agent Knowledge (Future):** If the system incorporates knowledge acquisition and reasoning capabilities, a knowledge graph (Neo4j) will be the primary option for managing this structured knowledge. Vector databases might be used to complement the knowledge graph for handling unstructured knowledge embeddings. 

**Technology Choices:**

* **Caching:** Python's `functools.lru_cache`
* **In-Memory Database:** Redis (potential alternative for short-term memory)
* **Relational Database:**  SQLite (initial implementation for long-term memory)
* **Vector Databases:**  FAISS, Milvus (alternatives for long-term memory)
* **Graph Database:**  Neo4j (potential alternative for long-term memory)

### 4.5 Orchestrator

**Description:** The Orchestrator is a crucial module responsible for managing task dependencies, workflow execution, and concurrency control between agents.

**Class Diagram:** (Refer to Figure 5: Orchestrator Class Diagram)

**Data Structures:**

*   **`Workflow`:**
    *   `workflow_id`: INTEGER (Primary Key)
    *   `name`: TEXT
    *   `description`: TEXT
    *   `tasks`:  LIST (A list of `Task` objects, potentially with additional metadata to define dependencies) 
*   **`TaskDependency` (Potentially Embedded in `Workflow`):**
    *   `parent_task_id`: INTEGER (Foreign Key to `tasks` table)
    *   `child_task_id`: INTEGER (Foreign Key to `tasks` table)

**Algorithms & Logic:**

*   **Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG):** The Orchestrator will represent workflows and task dependencies using a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). Python libraries like `networkx` or a dedicated workflow management library (like Apache Airflow, if complexity warrants it) can be used for DAG implementation. 
*   **Task Scheduling and Execution:**  A queue-based system will be used for task scheduling. Tasks will be added to the queue based on their dependencies and execution order defined in the DAG. 
*   **Concurrency Control:**  The Orchestrator will implement concurrency control mechanisms to prevent conflicts between agents accessing shared resources (e.g., memory, external APIs). Techniques such as:
    *   **Locks:**  To ensure exclusive access to shared resources.
    *   **Semaphores:** To limit the number of concurrent accesses to a resource.
    *   **Thread Pools:**  To manage and execute tasks concurrently using a pool of worker threads. 

**Concurrency Challenges and Solutions:**

*   **Deadlocks:**  Deadlocks can occur when multiple agents are waiting for each other to release resources.  Potential solutions include implementing deadlock detection and resolution mechanisms or using lock timeouts.
*   **Race Conditions:** Race conditions occur when the behavior of the system depends on the unpredictable timing of multiple agents accessing shared resources.  Strategies to prevent race conditions include proper synchronization using locks and careful design of shared data structures. 

## 5. Detailed Design 

### 5.1 API Design

**API Gateway:**  The API Gateway will expose RESTful API endpoints for user interaction and communication between system components. It will be designed with security, maintainability, and ease of use in mind.

**Endpoints (Example):**

* `/v1/tasks`:  (Versioned API) 
    - **POST:**  Creates a new task.
        - Request Body (JSON):
            ```json
            {

              // Other task-specific parameters
            }
            ```
        - Response (JSON): 
            ```json
            {
              "task_id": "generated_task_id",
              "status": "created" 
            }
            ```
    - **GET:** Retrieves a list of tasks or a specific task by ID.
        - Request Parameters:
            - `task_id` (optional):  The ID of the task to retrieve.
        - Response (JSON):
            - If `task_id` is provided, returns a single task object.
            - Otherwise, returns an array of task objects:
                ```json
                [
                  {
                    "task_id": "task_id_1",
                    "description": "Task 1 description",
                    "agent_assigned": "nlp",
                    "status": "in_progress",
                    // Other task details
                  },
                  // ... more tasks
                ]
                ```
    - **PUT:** Updates an existing task.
    - **DELETE:** Deletes a task. 
* `/v1/agents`:  
    - **GET:** Retrieves information about available agents and their capabilities. 
        - Response (JSON): 
            ```json

                "agent_id": "technical_agent",
                "type": "technical",
                "capabilities": ["code_generation", "debugging", "documentation"],
                "status": "available"
              }
            ]
            ```
* `/v1/memory`: 
    - **GET:** (Restricted Access) Retrieves long-term memory data.  Access will be controlled based on user roles and permissions. 
* `/v1/orchestrator`: 
    - **POST:** (Admin Access Only)  Manages workflows and task dependencies.

**Request/Response Formats:**  JSON will be used as the standard format for all API requests and responses.

**Error Handling:** Standardized error responses will be returned in JSON format, including HTTP status codes (e.g., 400 Bad Request for invalid input, 401 Unauthorized for authentication failures, 500 Internal Server Error for server-side errors) and descriptive error messages. 

**Error Response Format:**

```json
{
  "status": 400, // HTTP status code
  "error": "Bad Request", // Error type 
  "message": "Invalid input data.", // Human-readable message
  "code": "INVALID_INPUT", // Application-specific error code
  "details": {
    "field": "username",
    "issue": "Username is required" 
  } 
}
```

**Error Codes:**
(Refer to a separate document or section that lists common error codes, their descriptions, and potential solutions. This will be created during detailed design.)

**Authentication & Authorization:**

* **API Keys:**  For initial development, basic authentication using API keys will be implemented. API keys will be generated using Python's `secrets` module (`secrets.token_urlsafe(32)`) and stored securely as environment variables.  API keys will be generated upon user registration and displayed in the user's profile settings. The system will allow users to regenerate their API keys periodically to enhance security.
* **Future Considerations:**  In later stages, we will explore more robust authentication methods, potentially using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) or OAuth 2.0, as recommended by the research. Third-party authentication services (e.g., Auth0, Firebase) might be considered if appropriate. 

**Data Validation and Sanitization:**

* **Input Validation:** All incoming data will be validated against predefined schemas using a Python library like `Schema` or `pydantic`.  This will ensure that data meets the required format, type, and constraints. 
* **Sanitization:** Potentially harmful content, such as scripts or characters that could lead to SQL injection, will be sanitized using a library like `bleach`. 

**Documentation:**

* **OpenAPI (Swagger):** The API will be documented using the OpenAPI Specification (OAS), allowing for the generation of interactive documentation using tools like Swagger UI or ReDoc.  This will improve API usability and make it easier for developers (including yourself) to understand and interact with the system. 

### 5.2 Database Schema

**Database Technology:** SQLite will be used as the database management system for its simplicity and suitability for resource-constrained environments.  

**Schema Diagram:**  (Refer to Figure 6: Database Schema Diagram)

**Tables (Initial Design):**

* **`tasks`:**
    - `task_id`: INTEGER (Primary Key)
    - `description`: TEXT 
    - `status`: TEXT (e.g., 'created', 'in_progress', 'completed', 'failed')
    - `agent_assigned`:  TEXT 
    - `input_data`:  TEXT (Can store JSON data)
    - `output_data`: TEXT (Can store JSON data)
    - `created_at`: TIMESTAMP 
    - `updated_at`: TIMESTAMP 
* **`agents`:**
    - `agent_id`: TEXT (Primary Key)
    - `type`: TEXT (e.g., 'nlp', 'technical')
    - `status`: TEXT (e.g., 'available', 'busy', 'offline')
* **`agent_capabilities`:**
    - `agent_id`: TEXT (Foreign Key to `agents` table)
    - `capability`: TEXT 
    -  (Additional fields for proficiency levels or other metadata can be added later.)
* **`memory_records`:**
    - `record_id`: INTEGER (Primary Key)
    - `agent_id`: TEXT (Foreign Key to `agents` table)
    - `task_id`: INTEGER (Foreign Key to `tasks` table) 
    - `data`: TEXT (Can store JSON data)
    - `timestamp`: TIMESTAMP 
* **`workflows`:**
    - `workflow_id`: INTEGER (Primary Key)
    - `name`: TEXT
    - `description`: TEXT
    - `tasks`: TEXT (Can store a JSON array of task IDs and dependencies)

### 5.3 User Interface Design

**Command-Line Interface (CLI):**  The initial release will focus on a command-line interface for user interaction.

**Commands (Example):**
* `taskmaster create task "<description>"`: Creates a new task. 
    - Example: `taskmaster create task "Summarize the meeting notes"`
* `taskmaster list tasks`:  Lists all tasks.
* `taskmaster assign task <task_id> <agent_id>`: Assigns a task to an agent. 
    - Example: `taskmaster assign task 1 nlp_agent` 
* `taskmaster status <task_id>`:  Retrieves the status of a task.
* `taskmaster feedback <task_id> "<feedback>"`:  Provides feedback on a task.
    - Example: `taskmaster feedback 1 "The summary is too short."`

**Web-Based UI (Future Consideration):**  A basic web-based UI may be developed in later stages to provide a more user-friendly interface. Potential features include:

- **Task Dashboard:**  Visual overview of tasks, their status, and assigned agents.
- **Agent Management:** View agent capabilities and status.
- **Memory Exploration:**  Visualize and explore long-term memory data (with appropriate access controls).
- **Workflow Designer:**  Create and manage workflows visually (if advanced orchestration is implemented).
- **Technology Choice:** React will be the primary choice for the web-based UI. Data visualization libraries like D3.js or Chart.js and component libraries like Material UI (MUI) will be explored for enhanced UI elements. 

### 5.4 Agent Interaction

**Communication Protocol:**  Agents will communicate with the Core Engine using RESTful APIs, adhering to the API design specified in Section 5.1.

**Data Formats:**  JSON will be used as the standard data format for communication between agents and the Core Engine. 

### 5.5 Security Measures

**Data Encryption:**  Sensitive data at rest (e.g., user API keys, potentially sensitive data in long-term memory) will be encrypted using AES-256 in GCM (Galois/Counter Mode), a recommended mode for authenticated encryption. Encryption keys will be managed securely using environment variables and potentially a key rotation strategy in future iterations.

**Access Control:**  Basic access control will be enforced using API keys for authentication. Administrative functions, such as managing workflows, will require additional authorization checks.

**Input Validation:**  All user inputs will be validated and sanitized to prevent common web vulnerabilities:

* **SQL Injection:** Use parameterized queries or Object-Relational Mappers (ORMs) like SQLAlchemy to prevent SQL injection attacks.
* **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Escape user input before rendering it in HTML (if a web UI is implemented) and use a library like `bleach` for sanitization.
* **Other Validation:**  Use regular expressions for validating data formats (e.g., email addresses) and perform data type checking.

## 6. Implementation Strategy

**Development Approach:**

* **Agile Methodology:** The project will follow an Agile approach, with iterative development sprints of 2 weeks, focused on delivering core functionality first. 
* **Minimum Viable Product (MVP):**  The initial focus will be on developing an MVP with essential features, allowing for early testing and feedback. 
* **Gradual Expansion:** The system's capabilities will be gradually expanded in future iterations, incorporating "Should Have" and "Could Have" features as time and resources permit. 

**Technology Choices:** 

* **Backend:** Python 3.8+ with Flask/FastAPI framework.
* **Database:**  SQLite for initial development.
* **AI Models:**  Open-source models and APIs from Groq, OpenRouter AI, and Ollama.
* **Agent Communication:** RESTful APIs with JSON data format. 

**Tools:** 

* **Version Control:**  Git and GitHub
* **Integrated Development Environment (IDE):**  Visual Studio Code or PyCharm
* **Testing Frameworks:**  Pytest for unit testing and Robot Framework for integration testing.
* **Task Management:**  Trello or a similar Kanban board will be used for task management and sprint planning. 

## 7. Testing and Validation

**Testing Strategy:**

* **Unit Testing:**  Prioritized to test individual modules and functions in isolation using Pytest. 
* **Integration Testing:**  Focus on testing interactions between modules, especially between the Core Engine, agents, memory, and the orchestrator, using Robot Framework. 
* **BDD Testing (Limited):** May be used to validate specific user stories using Behave, but the scope will be limited due to time constraints. 

**Test Data:**  Smaller datasets will be used for initial testing to minimize costs associated with AI API calls. Mocking techniques may be used to simulate interactions with external AI services where feasible.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

* All core functionalities must pass unit tests with 100% code coverage.
* Essential integration tests must demonstrate successful interaction between modules, with no critical errors.
* The average response time for creating a new task should be under 2 seconds. 
* 90% of users should be able to successfully complete a basic task using the CLI without referring to the documentation.

## 8. Maintenance and Support

**Maintenance Plan:**

* **Regular Updates:** Updates and bug fixes will be released on an as-needed basis, considering the developer's time constraints. 
* **Performance Monitoring:**  Basic performance monitoring will be implemented, and optimizations will be made as time and resources allow. 

**Support Protocols:**

* **Documentation:** User and developer documentation will be regularly updated.
* **Issue Tracker:**  A public issue tracker (e.g., GitHub Issues) will be used to manage bug reports, feature requests, and track issue resolution.
* **Community Support (Future):**  A community forum may be considered for future development stages if the project gains traction.

## 9. Risks and Mitigation

                                    [CLI/Web UI] ---(Display Results)---> [User]
```

**Explanation:**
- A user creates a task request via the CLI or Web UI.
- The request goes to the API Gateway, then to the Core Engine.
- The Core Engine creates a Task object, selects the appropriate agent, and delegates the task.
- The Agent executes the task, using Short-Term Memory and potentially calling external AI APIs.
- The Orchestrator manages any task dependencies.
- The Memory Manager stores the results in Long-Term Memory.
- The response is sent back to the user via the API Gateway and UI.

### **Figure 6: Database Schema Diagram** 

(An Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) showing the tables: `tasks`, `agents`, `agent_capabilities`, `memory_records`, `workflows`, with their attributes and relationships.) 

**Entities (Tables):**

1.  **`tasks`:**
    -   `task_id`: INTEGER (Primary Key, Auto-increment) - Unique identifier for each task.
    -   `description`: TEXT - Description of the task.
    -   `status`: TEXT - Current status of the task (e.g., 'created', 'in_progress', 'completed', 'failed').
    -   `agent_assigned`: TEXT (Foreign Key referencing `agents.agent_id`) - ID of the agent assigned to the task.
    -   `input_data`: TEXT - Input data for the task, potentially in JSON format.
    -   `output_data`: TEXT - Output data from the task, potentially in JSON format.
    -   `created_at`: TIMESTAMP - Timestamp indicating when the task was created.
    -   `updated_at`: TIMESTAMP - Timestamp indicating when the task was last updated.

2.  **`agents`:**
    -   `agent_id`: TEXT (Primary Key) - Unique identifier for each agent.
    -   `type`: TEXT - Type of agent (e.g., 'nlp', 'technical').
    -   `status`: TEXT - Current status of the agent (e.g., 'available', 'busy', 'offline').

3.  **`agent_capabilities`:**
    -   `agent_id`: TEXT (Foreign Key referencing `agents.agent_id`) - ID of the agent.
    -   `capability`: TEXT - Name of a specific capability the agent possesses (e.g., 'summarization', 'code_generation'). 
    -   **(Optional) proficiency`:  INTEGER -  A numerical value (e.g., 1-5) to represent the agent's proficiency level in the capability. 

4.  **`memory_records`:**
    -   `record_id`: INTEGER (Primary Key, Auto-increment) - Unique identifier for each memory record.
    -   `agent_id`: TEXT (Foreign Key referencing `agents.agent_id`) - ID of the agent that created the record.
    -   `task_id`: INTEGER (Foreign Key referencing `tasks.task_id`) - ID of the task associated with the record.
    -   `data`: TEXT - The actual data stored in the memory record, potentially in JSON format.
    -   `timestamp`: TIMESTAMP - Timestamp indicating when the record was created.

5.  **`workflows`:**
    -   `workflow_id`: INTEGER (Primary Key, Auto-increment) - Unique identifier for each workflow.
    -   `name`: TEXT - Name of the workflow. 
    -   `description`: TEXT - Description of the workflow.
    -   `tasks`: TEXT - A JSON representation of the tasks involved in the workflow and their dependencies. The structure of this JSON can be defined during detailed design. 

**Relationships:**

*   **One-to-Many:**
    -   `agents` to `tasks` (An agent can be assigned to multiple tasks, but a task can only be assigned to one agent at a time).
    -   `agents` to `memory_records` (An agent can create multiple memory records).
    -   `tasks` to `memory_records` (A task can have multiple memory records associated with it).
*   **Many-to-Many:**
    -   `agents` to `capabilities` (An agent can have multiple capabilities, and a capability can be possessed by multiple agents). This relationship is implemented through the `agent_capabilities` table.

**Additional Notes:**

-   The `tasks` table could optionally include a `workflow_id` (Foreign Key referencing `workflows.workflow_id`) to link tasks directly to workflows if needed.
-   The JSON structure for representing task dependencies in the `workflows.tasks` field should be defined during the detailed design phase. 
-   The schema can be extended with additional tables or attributes as the system's functionality grows (e.g., a `users` table if user management is implemented).

I highly recommend using a visual diagramming tool to create a proper ERD diagram for better visualization and communication.
