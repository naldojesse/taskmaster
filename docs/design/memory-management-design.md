# Memory Management Design Document: TaskMaster AI

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the design of the Memory Management module for TaskMaster AI. The Memory Management module is responsible for handling the storage and retrieval of information for agents, using both short-term and long-term memory approaches. It plays a crucial role in maintaining conversational context, storing task results, and potentially managing agent knowledge.

## 2. Objectives

- **Efficiency:** Ensure efficient storage and retrieval of data.
- **Scalability:** Design the system to handle increasing amounts of data as the system grows.
- **Flexibility:** Allow for easy integration of different storage solutions.
- **Maintainability:** Ensure the system is easy to maintain and extend.

## 3. Memory Management Overview

The Memory Management module consists of two main components:
- **Short-Term Memory:** Used for temporary storage of frequently accessed data.
- **Long-Term Memory:** Used for persistent storage of data that needs to be retained over time.

## 4. Short-Term Memory

### 4.1 Description

Short-term memory is designed to store temporary information that is frequently accessed by agents. This includes conversational context, intermediate task results, and other transient data.

### 4.2 Implementation

For initial development, short-term memory will be implemented using Python's built-in `functools.lru_cache` decorator for simple caching. This approach minimizes resource consumption and is suitable for managing small amounts of frequently accessed data. The cache size (`maxsize=128`) was chosen based on typical usage patterns and can be adjusted as needed.

### 4.3 Alternative

If performance issues arise or more advanced caching features are needed, Redis will be considered as an alternative. Redis is an in-memory data structure store that offers high performance, persistence options, and scalability. The decision to switch to Redis will be based on specific performance metrics, such as cache hit rate and latency.

## 5. Long-Term Memory

### 5.1 Description

Long-term memory is designed to store persistent information that needs to be retained over time. This includes task results, agent knowledge, and historical data.

### 5.2 Implementation

Long-term memory will utilize a lightweight database (SQLite) for initial development. Data will be stored in tables with appropriate indexing to facilitate efficient retrieval. Concurrency will be managed using SQLite's built-in locking mechanisms, and data integrity will be ensured through transactions.

### 5.3 Alternatives

- **Vector Databases:** For tasks that involve similarity-based search, such as retrieving relevant conversational history or managing knowledge embeddings, vector databases like FAISS or Milvus will be considered.
- **Knowledge Graphs:** If TaskMaster AI's functionality expands to require more complex knowledge representation and reasoning, a graph database like Neo4j will be evaluated. The decision to switch to these alternatives will be based on specific use cases and performance metrics.

## 6. Memory Purging

A time-based purging mechanism will be implemented to remove memory records older than a configurable threshold (e.g., 30 days) to prevent long-term storage from growing unmanageably large. The threshold was chosen based on typical usage patterns and can be adjusted as needed.

## 7. Data Structures

### 7.1 MemoryRecord

Represents a record in memory, containing data, timestamps, and associated agent/task information.

```python
class MemoryRecord:
    def __init__(self, data, timestamp, agent_info, task_info):
        self.data = data
        self.timestamp = timestamp
        self.agent_info = agent_info
        self.task_info = task_info

    def serialize(self):
        return {
            'data': self.data,
            'timestamp': self.timestamp,
            'agent_info': self.agent_info,
            'task_info': self.task_info
        }

    @staticmethod
    def deserialize(data):
        return MemoryRecord(
            data['data'],
            data['timestamp'],
            data['agent_info'],
            data['task_info']
        )
```

## 8. Algorithms & Logic

### 8.1 Short-Term Memory

#### Implementation

```python
from functools import lru_cache

@lru_cache(maxsize=128)
def get_short_term_memory(key):
    # Retrieve data from short-term memory
    pass

def set_short_term_memory(key, value):
    get_short_term_memory.cache_clear()
    get_short_term_memory(key)
```

#### Alternative (Redis)

```python
import redis

redis_client = redis.StrictRedis(host='localhost', port=6379, db=0)

def get_short_term_memory(key):
    try:
        return redis_client.get(key)
    except redis.ConnectionError as e:
        # Handle connection error
        print(f"Redis connection error: {e}")
        return None

def set_short_term_memory(key, value):
    try:
        redis_client.set(key, value)
    except redis.ConnectionError as e:
        # Handle connection error
        print(f"Redis connection error: {e}")
```

### 8.2 Long-Term Memory

#### Implementation

```python
import sqlite3

def init_db():
    conn = sqlite3.connect('memory.db')
    c = conn.cursor()
    c.execute('''CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS memory
                 (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, data TEXT, timestamp TEXT, agent_info TEXT, task_info TEXT)''')
    conn.commit()
    conn.close()

def store_long_term_memory(data, timestamp, agent_info, task_info):
    conn = sqlite3.connect('memory.db')
    c = conn.cursor()
    c.execute("INSERT INTO memory (data, timestamp, agent_info, task_info) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?)",
              (data, timestamp, agent_info, task_info))
    conn.commit()
    conn.close()

def retrieve_long_term_memory(query):
    conn = sqlite3.connect('memory.db')
    c = conn.cursor()
    c.execute("SELECT * FROM memory WHERE data LIKE ?", ('%' + query + '%',))
    results = c.fetchall()
    conn.close()
    return results
```

## 9. Specific Considerations

- **Conversational History:** Short-term conversational history can be managed using the caching mechanism. Long-term history might be stored as embeddings in a vector database like FAISS or Milvus.
- **Task Results:** Recent task results can be cached, while a persistent database like SQLite or a knowledge graph like Neo4j can be used for storing and querying historical task data.
- **Agent Knowledge (Future):** If the system incorporates knowledge acquisition and reasoning capabilities, a knowledge graph (Neo4j) will be the primary option for managing this structured knowledge. Vector databases might be used to complement the knowledge graph for handling unstructured knowledge embeddings.

## 10. Technology Choices

- **Caching:** Python's `functools.lru_cache`
- **In-Memory Database:** Redis (potential alternative for short-term memory)
- **Relational Database:** SQLite (initial implementation for long-term memory)
- **Vector Databases:** FAISS, Milvus (alternatives for long-term memory)
- **Graph Database:** Neo4j (potential alternative for long-term memory)

## 11. Conclusion

This document provides a detailed design for the Memory Management module of TaskMaster AI. The design emphasizes efficiency, scalability, flexibility, and maintainability to ensure the system can handle the growing complexity and data requirements of TaskMaster AI.
