    - Executed with stakeholder (developer as the initial stakeholder) involvement to provide feedback and confirm acceptance criteria.

## 5. Test Environment

* **Development Environment:**  Initial testing will be conducted on the developer's local machine, using a virtual environment (`venv`) to isolate dependencies.
* **Testing Database:** A dedicated testing database (SQLite) will be used for integration and system tests to avoid impacting the production database.
* **Mocking (for AI APIs):**  Mocking frameworks (e.g., `unittest.mock`) will be used to simulate responses from external AI APIs during unit and integration testing to minimize costs and ensure consistent test results. 

### 5.1 Test Environment Management

Managing multiple test environments is crucial for isolating data, avoiding conflicts, and ensuring a smooth development and deployment process. As a solo developer, prioritizing simplicity and cost-effectiveness is key.

**Initial Approach (Environment Variables):**

- Use environment variables to store environment-specific settings (e.g., database URLs, API keys). Manage these variables using a `.env` file and the `python-dotenv` library.

**Recommended Approach (Docker Compose - Future):**

- As the project grows, transition to using Docker Compose to create containerized environments for testing, staging, and potentially production. 
- Docker Compose allows you to define and manage multi-container applications, making it easier to replicate and manage different environments with their specific configurations.

**Benefits of Docker Compose:**

- **Isolation:** Each environment runs in its own isolated container, preventing conflicts.
- **Consistency:** Environments are easily reproducible, ensuring consistent testing conditions.
- **Scalability:**  Docker Compose can be used to scale your application in the future by defining and managing multiple containers.

## 6. Test Data

* **Smaller Datasets:**  Smaller datasets will be used for initial testing, especially for tasks involving AI model calls. This helps reduce API usage costs and allows for faster test execution.
* **Representative Data:**  Test data should be representative of real-world usage scenarios to ensure the system is evaluated effectively.
* **Edge Cases:**  Test cases should include edge cases and boundary conditions to validate the system's robustness and error handling.
* **Test Data Management:**  A system for managing test data will be implemented, potentially using scripts or dedicated tools, to generate, load, and clean up test data as needed. 

### 6.1. Test Data Selection and Creation

**Selecting Representative Data:**

- **Public Datasets:** Explore publicly available datasets related to NLP or technical tasks, such as:
    - Text summarization datasets (e.g., CNN/Daily Mail, WikiHow).
    - Question answering datasets (e.g., SQuAD, Natural Questions).
    - Code generation datasets (e.g., GitHub repositories).
- **Sample Data Generation:** Create scripts or use tools to generate sample data that mimics real-world inputs for your agents.

**Creating Test Data:**

- **Scripts:** Write Python scripts to generate test data in the required formats (text, code, etc.).
- **Data Generation Tools:** Consider using tools like Faker to create realistic and diverse test data (e.g., names, addresses, text snippets).

**Data Anonymization:**

- If you use real user data, ensure it's properly anonymized to protect privacy and comply with regulations like GDPR and CCPA.

### 6.2. Ensuring Test Data Quality

Using high-quality, representative test data is crucial for effective testing.  

**Strategies to Ensure Data Quality:**

- **Data Validation:** Implement validation checks in your test data generation scripts to ensure the data conforms to expected formats, data types, and constraints. 
- **Data Diversity:**  Generate a diverse range of data points to cover different scenarios and edge cases. 
- **Manual Review:** Manually review a sample of the generated data to ensure it is realistic and relevant to the tasks being tested. 

## 7.  Acceptance Criteria

    - Stakeholder involvement is essential during this phase to provide feedback and confirm acceptance criteria. The developer will act as the initial stakeholder, and feedback from potential users will be sought in future stages.  

### 8.1. Regression Testing

**Importance:**

Regression testing is essential to ensure that new code changes or bug fixes do not introduce unexpected issues into previously working functionalities. 

**Strategies:**

* **Test Suite Subset:**  After each significant code change, re-run a subset of relevant unit and integration tests to verify that core functionalities remain intact.
* **Prioritize Critical Tests:**  Focus on tests that cover critical features, areas affected by recent changes, or parts of the system that are prone to errors.
* **Run Before Merging:** Execute regression tests before merging new code into the main branch to prevent integration issues.
* **Automated Regression (Future):**  As part of the future CI/CD pipeline implementation, automate regression testing to run after each code commit or build. 

## 9.  Defect Tracking and Management

* **Issue Tracker:**  A dedicated issue tracker (e.g., GitHub Issues) will be used to log and track defects found during testing. 
* **Severity Levels:** Defects will be categorized by severity (e.g., critical, major, minor) to prioritize fixes. 
* **Resolution Process:**  A clear process for defect resolution will be established, including steps for reporting, reproducing, assigning, fixing, and verifying fixes.

## 10. Continuous Integration and Testing

* **Future Goal:** Implement a continuous integration and testing (CI/CT) pipeline in future development stages to automate the execution of tests and provide rapid feedback on code changes. 
* **Potential Tools:**  GitHub Actions or a similar CI/CD platform will be considered.

## 11. Reporting

* **Test Reports:**  Test reports will be generated after each testing phase, summarizing the results, including:
    - Number of test cases executed.
    - Number of passed, failed, and skipped tests.
    - Code coverage metrics.
    - Performance metrics (response times, resource usage).
    - Details of any defects found.
* **Reporting Tools:**  Pytest and Robot Framework have built-in reporting features that will be used to generate test reports. 

## 12. Mocking External AI APIs 

**Benefits of Mocking:**

- **Cost Savings:** Mocking avoids making real API calls, saving you money, especially during frequent testing.
- **Consistent Results:** Mocks provide predictable responses, eliminating inconsistencies due to network issues or changes in the external API.
- **Dependency Isolation:** Mocking allows you to isolate individual components and test their behavior independently of external services.

**Mocking Libraries:**

* **`unittest.mock`:** Python's built-in mocking library, suitable for mocking objects and functions.
* **`requests_mock`:** A specialized library for mocking HTTP requests, ideal for simulating API calls. 

**Examples:**

* **Mocking a Groq API call using `requests_mock`:**

```python
import unittest
import requests_mock
from your_module import your_function_that_calls_groq_api  # Replace with your actual function

class TestGroqIntegration(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_successful_groq_call(self):
        with requests_mock.Mocker() as m:
            mock_response_data = {"result": "This is a mocked Groq response"}
            m.post("https://api.groq.com/v1/models/your-model-id/generate", json=mock_response_data, status_code=200)

            result = your_function_that_calls_groq_api("your input text")
            self.assertEqual(result, mock_response_data)  

    def test_groq_api_error(self):
        with requests_mock.Mocker() as m:
            m.post("https://api.groq.com/v1/models/your-model-id/generate", status_code=500)

            result = your_function_that_calls_groq_api("your input text")
            self.assertIsNone(result)  # Or handle the error appropriately

```

* **Mocking an object method using `unittest.mock`:**

```python
import unittest
from unittest.mock import patch

class YourClass:
    def get_data_from_api(self):
        # Code that makes an API call
        pass

class TestYourClass(unittest.TestCase):
    @patch.object(YourClass, 'get_data_from_api')
    def test_object_method(self, mock_get_data):
        mock_get_data.return_value = {"data": "Mocked data"}
        instance = YourClass()
        result = instance.get_data_from_api()
        self.assertEqual(result, {"data": "Mocked data"})

```

**Limitations of Mocking:**

- **Tight Coupling:** Tests can become tightly coupled to the specific implementation being mocked.
- **Inaccurate Simulation:** Mocks might not perfectly represent the behavior of the real API, especially in complex interactions. 

**When to Supplement Mocking:**

- **Critical Paths:** Test critical functionalities that heavily rely on external APIs using live API calls to ensure end-to-end integration.
- **API Changes:** Perform live tests after significant changes to external APIs to catch breaking changes that mocks might not detect. 
- **Performance Testing:**  Live API calls are necessary for performance testing to accurately measure response times and resource usage.
