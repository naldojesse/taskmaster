# TaskMaster AI

TaskMaster AI is a modular AI agent framework designed to automate tasks and streamline workflows. It integrates various AI functionalities with human-AI collaboration to enhance productivity.

## Features

- **Human-AI Collaboration:** Seamless integration with human oversight, enabling task assignment, real-time feedback, and agent behavior adjustment.
- **Modularity:** System architecture based on distinct, reusable modules for maintainability and extensibility.
- **NLP Agent:** Specializes in NLP tasks like text summarization, information extraction, and response generation.
- **Technical Agent:** Assists with coding tasks including code generation, debugging, and documentation creation.
- **Memory Management:** Implements basic short-term and long-term information storage and retrieval for agents.
- **Orchestration:** Manages task dependencies, sequencing, and parallel execution of agent actions.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/taskmaster-ai.git
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:
    ```bash

    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Set up environment variables and run initial setup scripts.

## Usage

Interact with TaskMaster AI using the command-line interface (CLI):

- Create a new task: `taskmaster create task "Summarize the meeting notes"`
- List all tasks: `taskmaster list tasks`
- Assign a task to an agent: `taskmaster assign task <task_id> nlp_agent`
- Check task status: `taskmaster status <task_id>`
- Provide feedback on a task: `taskmaster feedback <task_id> "The summary is too short."`
